      Hello, and welcome! Just a bit about me... <br>
      <br>
      I love to write because I love getting to know characters and telling their stories. Sometimes I get it right on my first go, but more often than not it takes a couple of tries before I truly understand a character and write them authentically. When their worlds become vivid, their words candid, and their thoughts and motivations natural, I feel as if I have brought a character to life.<br><br>
      I live in the southeast United States, and I am a wife and mother to one human child, a dog, and two cats. I am also a leukemia survivor. <br><br>
      I truly appreciate your interest in my writing! I hope you enjoy what I create and come back for more.<br><br>
      Thankfully, <br>
      Mollie Annah Walker
